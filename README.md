# 🚗 Vehicle CO₂ Emissions Analysis

This is my term project exploring the relationship between vehicle characteristics and carbon dioxide emissions. This repository includes data analysis, documentation, and a presentation of findings.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to investigate how factors like engine size, fuel consumption, and vehicle type influence CO₂ emissions. Using Python and real-world data, I performed exploratory data analysis, visualized key trends, and summarized insights in both written and presentation formats.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `/data` | Dataset used for analysis |
| `/notebooks` | Jupyter notebook with data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations |
| `/docs` | Final project report |
| `/presentation` | Presentation slides summarizing key findings |

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Microsoft Word & PowerPoint

## 📌 Key Insights

- Fuel consumption and engine size are strong predictors of CO₂ emissions.
- Hybrid and electric vehicles show significantly lower emissions.
- Data visualization helped uncover patterns not immediately obvious from raw data.
